/**
 * Verifies that a portal user has access to manage FlowEngine instances.
 *
 * Access is granted to:
 * - Portal owners (have records in pay_per_instance_deployments as user_id)
 * - Agency managers (have records as invited_by_user_id)
 * - Team members acting on behalf of an owner (resolved via getEffectiveOwnerId)
 * - Fresh portal owners with no local instances (instances live only in FlowEngine's DB)
 *
 * Access is DENIED to:
 * - Pure clients (only in client_instances, no ownership records)
 *
 * Returns { authorized, effectiveUserId, role } — role is the team role for permission checks.
